This Repository includes a cleaner version of the Horiseon website.  The changes fixed a broken link, used better indentation, added alt tags to images, added comments to the css, and condensed/organized css ids/classes.  It also fixed the aside tab to properly fit next to the main section and transforming the images to their correct size.
